This repository demonstrates a complete Git version control workflow â€” covering everything from "basic commits to advanced branching, merging, conflicts, stashing, and pull requests."  
- Repository initialization and commits  
- Branching (feature, hotfix, and integration)  
- Merging and resolving conflicts manually  
- Staging, unstaging, and partial commits (`git add -p`)  
- Using `.gitignore` effectively  
- Handling remote branches  
- Forking and creating pull requests  
- Advanced stash operations and recovery  
- Revert and reset demonstrations
